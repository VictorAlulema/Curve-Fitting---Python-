Curve fitting in python

Python version: 3
To execute, run fitting.py and write the following command in the shell:

fitting('quad.txt', '\t' , 2 , plot = True)


In this case 'quad.txt' is the file name that contains the data (x,y)
'\t' is the separator character used in the file 'quad.txt'
2 is the order of the polynomial to fit the given data
plot  = True | means that the figure will be displayed
plot  = False | means that the figure wont be displayed


The function can be executed as many times you want.
